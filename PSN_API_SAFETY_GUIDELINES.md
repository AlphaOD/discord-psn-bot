# 🛡️ PlayStation Network Public API - Safety Guidelines & Best Practices

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

**30-minute intervals are EXCELLENT** for PlayStation Network public API usage. Using public endpoints without authentication provides maximum safety and reliability while respecting Sony's servers.

## 🌐 **Public API Approach - Maximum Safety**

### **✅ Why Public API is Safer:**

1. **No Authentication Required**
   - No NPSSO tokens or passwords needed
   - No risk of credential misuse or exposure
   - No token expiration or refresh issues
   - Users simply provide their PSN username

2. **Public Data Only**
   - Only accesses data that's already public
   - Respects user privacy settings automatically
   - Cannot access private or hidden information
   - Same data visible on PlayStation websites

3. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Fewer failure points than token-based systems
   - No complex authentication flows
   - Reduced maintenance and complexity
   - More reliable long-term operation

## 🔍 **Rate Limiting for Public Endpoints**

### **✅ Our Conservative Approach:**

1. **30-Minute Trophy Checks**: ✅ **Extremely safe**
   - Well below any reasonable rate limits
   - Allows proper data processing between calls
   - Reduces server load to minimum
   - Industry standard for trophy tracking

2. **API Call Patterns:**
   ```
   Every 30 minutes:
   ├── Check recent games for active users
   ├── 2-second delays between user checks
   ├── 500ms delays between game trophy checks
   ├── Proper timeout handling (30 seconds)
   └── Graceful error handling and backoff
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting Safety:**
   - **Individual user checks**: 1 every 30 minutes
   - **Between-user delays**: 2 seconds minimum
   - **Game trophy checks**: 500ms spacing
   - **Total throughput**: ~30 users per minute maximum

## 🏆 **Public Trophy Data Access**

### **✅ What We Can Access Safely:**
- Public trophy achievements and timestamps
- Game progress and completion data
- Trophy rarity and difficulty information
- User trophy levels and statistics
- Recently played games list

### **✅ What We Cannot Access (Good!):**
- Private or hidden trophy data
- Account credentials or tokens
- Social features or friends lists
- Store purchase information
- Real-time gaming sessions

### **✅ Privacy Respect:**
- Honors user's PlayStation privacy settings
- Only shows data user has made public
- Cannot bypass privacy restrictions
- Same visibility as PlayStation websites

---

## 🛡️ **Account Safety - Zero Risk Approach**

### **✅ Maximum Safety Features:**

1. **No Credential Storage**
   - Only stores PSN usernames (public information)
   - No tokens, passwords, or sensitive data
   - Cannot compromise user accounts
   - Users remain in full control

2. **Read-Only Public Access**
   - Cannot modify any account data
   - Cannot perform actions on behalf of users
   - Cannot access private information
   - Zero risk of account compromise

3. **Transparent Operation**
   - Users know exactly what data is accessed
   - Clear documentation of limitations
   - Easy to understand and verify
   - No hidden authentication processes

## 📊 **Risk Assessment - Public API**

| Factor | Risk Level | Public API Benefits |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **User credentials** | 🟢 **Zero Risk** | No credentials needed |
| **Account access** | 🟢 **Zero Risk** | Public data only |
| **Privacy concerns** | 🟢 **Zero Risk** | Respects all privacy settings |
| **Rate limiting** | 🟢 **Very Low** | Conservative 30-min intervals |
| **Service reliability** | 🟢 **High** | No auth failures or token issues |
| **Long-term stability** | 🟢 **High** | Independent of auth changes |

**Overall Risk:** 🟢 **Zero to Minimal**

## 🏢 **Public API Usage Examples**

### **Similar Services Using Public Data:**

1. **PlayStation Store Web Interface**
   - Uses public APIs for trophy display
   - Shows same data we access
   - Sony's own public implementation

2. **Community Trophy Sites**
   - TrueTrophies, PSNProfiles, etc.
   - Access public trophy data
   - Operate safely for years

3. **PlayStation Mobile App (Public Views)**
   - Displays public trophy information
   - Shows user profiles and achievements
   - Sony's reference implementation

### **Technical Implementation:**

- **No reverse engineering**: Uses intended public interfaces

---

## ⚖️ **Legal & ToS Compliance - Enhanced**

### **✅ Maximum Compliance:**
- **Public data only** - respects all privacy settings
- **No authentication bypass** - uses intended public access
- **Conservative usage** - minimal server impact
- **User transparency** - clear about data accessed
- **No credential harvesting** - impossible with public API

### **✅ Best Practices:**
- Rate limiting well below any reasonable limits
- Proper error handling and backoff
- Transparent user communication
- Easy unlinking/opt-out process
- Minimal data retention

## 🔧 **Implementation Safety Features**

### **Current Bot Safety Implementation:**

```javascript
// Conservative rate limiting
const trophyCheckInterval = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes
const userDelay = 2000; // 2 seconds between users
const gameDelay = 500; // 500ms between game checks

// Timeout protection
const apiTimeout = 30000; // 30 seconds per call

// Error handling with backoff
try {
    const result = await publicApi.withTimeout(apiCall(), apiTimeout);
} catch (error) {
    logger.warn('API call failed, will retry next cycle');
    // Automatic retry with next scheduled check
}
```

### **Enhanced Safety Measures:**

1. **Smart User Selection**
   ```javascript
   // Only check users with recent Discord activity
   const activeUsers = users.filter(user => 
       user.lastSeen > Date.now() - (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
   );
   ```

2. **Intelligent Game Filtering**
   ```javascript
   // Only check games played since last trophy check
   const recentGames = games.filter(game => 
       game.lastPlayedDateTime > user.lastTrophyCheck
   );
   ```

3. **Progressive Backoff**
   ```javascript
   // Increase delays on repeated failures
   if (consecutiveFailures > 3) {
       const backoffDelay = Math.min(300000, 2000 * Math.pow(2, failures));
       await sleep(backoffDelay);
   }
   ```

### **Excellent Scalability:**
- **1-1000 users**: 🟢 Zero concerns
- **1000-5000 users**: 🟢 Excellent performance
- **5000+ users**: 🟢 Still very manageable
- **Large scale**: Consider load balancing

### **Scaling Advantages:**
1. **No token management overhead**
2. **Fewer failure modes**
3. **Predictable performance**
4. **No authentication bottlenecks**

1. **Zero authentication risk** - no credentials involved
2. **Maximum privacy respect** - only public data
3. **Excellent reliability** - no token failures
4. **Future-proof** - independent of auth changes
5. **User-friendly** - simple username linking

### **Minor Optimizations:**

1. **User Activity Filtering**
   ```javascript
   // Skip inactive Discord users
   const activeThreshold = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 7 days
   const activeUsers = users.filter(u => u.lastSeen > Date.now() - activeThreshold);
   ```

2. **Smart Game Selection**
   ```javascript
   // Only check recently played games
   const recentGames = games.filter(g => 
       g.lastPlayedDateTime > user.lastTrophyCheck
   ).slice(0, 10); // Limit to 10 most recent
   ```
